These skills will prepare students for any vocation, present or future (e.g. Archer et al. 2010).

For example, ableism not only causes hindrances to accessibility, such as failure to install wheelchair ramps or use braille or ASL interpreters, but it also means discriminating against applicants with disabilities, having a negative attitude towards disabilities, and not acknowledging disabilities that are not visible."
